              Hi, I'm a passionate web developer with 5+ years of experience building modern web applications. 
              My journey in tech started when I built my first website at the age of 15, 
              and I've been hooked on creating digital experiences ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend frameworks, 
              but I'm also comfortable working with backend technologies. 
              I love learning new technologies and techniques to improve my craft.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading sci-fi novels, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
            </p>
